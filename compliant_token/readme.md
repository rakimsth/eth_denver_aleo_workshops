This Aleo smart contract defines a whitelisted token system where only approved users from permitted jurisdictions can receive token transfers. Here’s a breakdown of its features and improvements:

## Key Features

1. Admin-Only Controls:

- Only the ADMIN_ADDRESS can add/remove users to/from the whitelist.
- Only the ADMIN_ADDRESS can add/remove allowed jurisdictions.

2. Access Control Mechanisms:

- Uses two mappings:
  - whitelist: address => bool → Stores approved wallet addresses.
  - allowed_jurisdictions: string => bool → Stores permitted country codes.

3. Compliance-Based Token Transfers:

- Ensures only whitelisted users can receive tokens.
- Ensures recipient’s country is in the allowed list.
- Uses prehook and transfer functions from token_registry.aleo to handle token movement securely.

4. Asynchronous Transaction Finalization:

- Uses a Future mechanism to ensure proper transaction finalization.
