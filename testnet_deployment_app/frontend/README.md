# Pregnancy Check App

This application is built using create-leo-app inorder to interact with the aleo program written to check the status of the pregnancy without revealing much information

# Steps

1. npm i
2. npm run build
3. npm run preview

The reason for build instead of running in dev env is to ensure that the wasm files are compiled using the webpack inorder for the aleo program to work.
